# Roadmap / Current State

Build-state half of the roadmap. Track strategy/sequencing moved to the cloud brain
(`brain/cloud/synthesized/track-strategy.md` when mounted) — split 2026-07-10 by the
hubble-init apply run.

## ➤ NEXT STEP (updated 2026-07-09, post-apply-run)

**Apply-mode is built and has run for real once**: `567-platform/brain` was split into
the "567 Brain" Hubble workspace on dev (Adrian's call to use a real repo instead of a
throwaway corpus; git remote = the safety net). Move commit `567-platform@180eebc`,
run record `/specs/hubble-init/runs/2026-07-09-567-brain-apply-run.md`, skill rules
13–16 extracted. CLI grew auth-token plumbing + `folder create/list/export` +
`document create` (uncommitted → committed this session).

Next session, in order:

1. ~~Desktop repo-link the "567 Brain" folder~~ **✅ verified 2026-07-10** live with
   Adrian: workspace "567 Product Brain" appears via owner membership in the
   repo-link picker (gap #10 fix not needed for this path), mounted over
   `567-platform/brain/cloud/` (repo root = 567-platform), git exclude + BRAIN.md
   confirmed, and live watch verified BOTH directions — app edit → file, and file
   append → cloud reconcile in ~5s. Stale CLI export archived and replaced by the
   live mount. UX learnings: the repo picker wants the git root (users try the
   mount dir — "not a repo" error), and the mount-path field silently keeps stale
   values across relinks.
2. ~~Fix serializer bugs (DESIGN.md §Gap #8)~~ **✅ done 2026-07-10** (working
   tree, uncommitted): all four bugs fixed in `packages/editor` — nested-emphasis
   divergence, lone `~` doubling, verbatim frontmatter round-trip (frozen
   decision: opaque block, no structured editing), bare-URL/autolink
   preservation. `roundTrip.test.ts` is the idempotency guard. Follow-up: four
   call sites pre-strip frontmatter and should adopt the new path
   (`packages/ui` EditorView ×2, desktop `App.tsx`, www EditorView). Gap #9
   (workspace ownership transfer / `hubble login`) is the auth follow-up.
3. ~~Split THIS repo's `brain/`~~ **✅ done 2026-07-10** — Track C target 2 executed
   by the hubble-init apply run: 10 docs (8 whole + cloud halves of decision-log and
   roadmap) → "Hubble Brain" folder, workspace "Hubble Product Brain" (dev), Adrian
   owner member. Export-diff gate passed (whitespace normalization + one mark-order
   canonicalization; zero content loss; all exports are round-trip fixed points).
   RESOLVER+BRAINKEEPER consolidated into one governance doc. Run record:
   `/specs/hubble-init/runs/2026-07-10-hubble-brain-apply-run.md`.

## ➤ NEXT STEP (updated 2026-07-11, Phases 1+2 LIVE-VERIFIED)

**Magic-flow Phases 1+2 are implemented AND live-verified** (commits `f51023a`,
`79f6024`; run record `specs/hubble-init/runs/2026-07-11-magic-flow-live-acceptance.md`):
`hubble login` device flow proven end-to-end on dev (approve became an action —
nested mutations lose built-in env vars); `hubble mount` proven zero-click on a
scratch repo (both sync directions ≤12s) and **`brain/cloud/` here is now a live
mount** (11 docs; local 2026-07-11 entries merged up; slug-era files removed;
git-side refs updated to the title-based projection names).

**Next build step: Phase 3 — ensure-desktop install magic**, then Phase 4 =
repo-link form fixes (mount-list liveness already shipped with Phase 2). New from
the acceptance run, feed into Phase 3/4 scope: (a) projection naming split — the
desktop materializer names by doc title, `folder export` by doc path; pick one
canonical scheme; (b) duplication feedback loop — `cloud document create` with
title≠path into a watched mount ping-pongs materialize↔ingest (6 copies before
stabilizing); the new-local-file ingestion path needs an idempotency guard;
(c) `cloud create` connects the cwd as a workspace path — the skill must run it
from a scratch cwd.

Desktop IA follow-up (direction settled 2026-07-11): replace the simultaneous
**Folders** / **Live Documents** / **On this computer** sidebar with one current
context and one folder/document tree. Repo-linked projections become contextual
folder availability; remove standalone local-authority editing while preserving local
editing through watched projections of cloud folders. New documents inherit folder
access, and root documents have no direct/guest shares by default while retaining
normal workspace-member access.
Source: `brain/cloud/sources/2026-07-11-desktop-navigation-ia.md`. Schedule the
implementation after the Phase 2 dogfood so the relink run can preserve evidence of
the current friction before the sidebar is replaced.

Backlog (non-blocking): serializer continuation-indent preservation
(`packages/editor`, whitespace-only normalization from the split run); frontmatter
call-site adoption (4 sites); Track D vision extraction (Adrian-gated); production
deploy/QA gates still not run.

## Where the build actually is (2026-07-09)

- Branch `v1-release`. RB1–RB7 repo-brain code phases are **committed** (folder shares,
  guest web experience, desktop repo-link mount + BRAIN.md seeding, guest onboarding,
  launch-gate prep) — see git log 2026-07-03..05.
- GFM table support **committed** (`65c21c6`): shared Tiptap table schema, markdown
  round-trip, slash-command insertion, floating table controls. Shipped mid-apply-run
  after the run's verification caught tables being silently dropped (the exact
  data-loss bug the safety gate exists for); dev backend redeployed with it.
- **Uncommitted work in the tree** (not yet described by any doc): `SpaceSwitcher.tsx`,
  `packages/cloud-ui/`, edits across desktop + www shells, members backend. Needs a
  fact-check/documentation pass before it drifts.
- Production deploy/QA gates were deferred by the pivot (one repo-first launch) and
  remain not run. QA runbook: `/specs/realtime-collab/TEST-RUNBOOK.md`.
